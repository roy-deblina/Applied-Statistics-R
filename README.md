# Applied-Statistics-R

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects completed in R. These projects showcase skills in statistical modeling, data visualization, and custom algorithm implementation.

1. Predictive Hotel Pricing Model
Project Overview: Developed a multiple linear regression model to predict hotel prices based on factors like comfort, amenities, and value for money. The analysis identified key drivers of pricing and provided a predictive tool for business decision-making.
Key Skills:
Statistical Modeling: Built and validated a regression model, interpreting coefficients to understand their impact on pricing.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducted t-tests and F-tests to assess the statistical significance of model parameters and overall model fit.
Data Visualization: Created scatter plots, residual plots, and Q-Q plots using ggplot2 to diagnose model assumptions and visualize relationships.
Tools: R, RMarkdown, ggplot2, dplyr

2. Recidivism Survival Analysis
Project Overview: Conducted a survival analysis to investigate the socio-economic factors influencing the time until a former prisoner is rearrested.
Key Skills:
Survival Analysis: Implemented Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards models to analyze time-to-event data.
Statistical Inference: Interpreted hazard ratios to identify key predictors of recidivism, such as financial aid and the number of prior convictions.
Data Manipulation: Utilized dplyr for data cleaning, filtering, and preparation for survival analysis.
Tools: R, RMarkdown, survival, survminer, dplyr

3. Sustainable Lobster Harvest Strategy
Project Overview: Analyzed lobster catch data to develop a sustainable harvesting strategy based on carapace length.
Key Skills:
Logistic Regression: Modeled the probability of a lobster being mature based on its size to establish a scientific basis for minimum catch size.
Decision Science: Evaluated the trade-offs between yield, revenue, and population sustainability by simulating different harvesting cutoff points.
Data Storytelling: Presented a clear, data-driven recommendation to stakeholders, balancing economic and ecological goals.
Tools: R, RMarkdown, ggplot2, dplyr

4. Foundational R Programming and Analysis
Project Overview: This project covered fundamental R programming concepts, including vector and data frame manipulation, creating user-defined functions, and generating plots with base R graphics.
Key Skills:
Vector Manipulation: Created, sorted, and performed arithmetic operations on vectors.
Function Definition: Wrote a custom function to implement a trigonometric expression, y = sin(x/2) + cos(x/2).
Plotting: Generated plots of functions, identified maxima, and added custom annotations and text to the display.
Tools: R (Base), RMarkdown

5. Chi-Squared Test Implementation from Scratch
Project Overview: Wrote a custom R function to perform a Chi-Squared test for independence on a two-way contingency table, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying statistical theory.
Key Skills:
Statistical Programming: Implemented the Chi-Squared statistic, calculated degrees of freedom, and determined the p-value without relying on built-in R functions.
Algorithm Development: Translated a core statistical formula into functional, reusable R code.
Function Design: Created a robust function with clear inputs (contingency table) and outputs (Chi-squared statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value).
Tools: R, RMarkdown
